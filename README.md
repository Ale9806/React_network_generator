# React network generator

This is the workflow I have been doing for a couple of weeks. Disclaimer ( This project is not finished) <br>
The idea is simple: <br>
1.- We obtain Data, in order to achive that we use mod to genrate molecules. <br>
2.- Data prep, as in any project Data has to be cleaned in order to use it.  <br>
3.- Load Data to a Non relational Data base.  <br>
4.- Quey the Data. <br>
<br>
Step 2 is the most "problematic" so far, we need to find a way to effectively get rid of tautomers.
