# Neo4j
### What is Neo4j?
Neo4j is an open-source, NoSQL, native graph database that provides an ACID-compliant transactional backend for your applications. <br> For short:  Neo4j is a graph database
### How do I code in Neo4J?
Using Cypher, Cypher is a declarative query language similar to SQL, but optimized for graphs. Now used by other databases like SAP HANA Graph and Redis graph via the openCypher project.
### Why Neo4j?
We could store our network in a matirx, but since we are working with graphs, the most logical solution is to use a "graph" database to store our "graph" representation.
There are other options in hand, but Neo4j has a huge comunity. It is also importnat to keep in mind that Neo4j has at least 2 different python drivers.
### What is a driver?
Neo4j client applications require a Driver Object which, from a data access perspective, forms the backbone of the application. It is through this object that all Neo4j interaction is carried out, and it should therefore be made available to all parts of the application that require data access.
### What is an object?
An object, in object-oriented programming (OOP), is an abstract data type created by a developer. It can include multiple properties and methods and may even contain other objects. In most programming languages, objects are defined as classes.
Objects provide a structured approach to programming.
